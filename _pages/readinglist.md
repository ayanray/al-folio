<h4>Reading List</h4>
<p>I've often been asked which books I've read, and would you recommend them. I'm an avid reader, and the books below I've read over the past 2 years or so...</p>

<h5>Strategy</h5>
- Playing to Win
  - good overall strategy book (simple to follow)
- Blue Ocean Strategy
  - must read imo, though you would think differently if you read Porters‚Äô books first and then read this
- Crossing the Chasm
  - must read for this company. We still kind of in the middle of the chasm‚Ä¶
- Competitive Advantage of Nations
  - mind blowing imo. it‚Äôs like reading a textbook though‚Ä¶ 
- Competitive Advantage
- Competitive Strategy 
- Innovators Dilemma
  - good, but isn‚Äôt as deeply structured as above
- Lords of Strategy
  - nice history book
- The Four
  - lots of interesting info - like Apple stores = temples of worship ü§£ 
- Art of War
  - though I think it wasn‚Äôt original - but maybe original is in Chinese ü§£  - good rough lessons ‚Ä¶ (appear weak if you are strong, appear strong if you are weak, stand and fight if on death land, fight from above, etc.)
- Good Strategy Bad Strategy
  - Good case studies. I like that good strategy should be "interesting".
- HBR 10 Must Reads: On Strategy
  - Good overall summary on many topics.

<h5>General Management</h5>
- In Search of Excellence
  - I‚Äôm a huge fan of the ‚Äúchampions‚Äù idea. I don‚Äôt recall a lot of this book though. 
- Reengineering the Corporation
  - Interesting book - I took away that at some point (at GM), finance managers took over management and this is a 50-80 year anti-pattern imo
- Key Performance Indicators
  - Like an encyclopedia for KPIs ‚Äî better to just use wikipedia. 
- Principles
  - Must read
- Management
  - Must read. This is the most scientific approach to management imo. Get the 1st edition, not the revised.
- Customer Funded Business
  - Good ideas and case studies (Dell - negative cash conversion cycle ‚Äî Tesla is doing this now too with deposits‚Ä¶ great stuff)
- Innovation & Entrepreneurship
  - It‚Äôs ok. Kind of obvious after reading it. Watching a video vs. reading this book doesn‚Äôt do it justice, you should just read it. 
- Scaling Up
  - I took an MBA course from IE where the professor said he read this book 4 times. It‚Äôs pretty good. Very opinionated though.
- High Output Management
  - Must read. First management book I read. It‚Äôs the tip of the ice burg imo. 
- No Rules Rules
  - Must read. Hastings is a visionary imo when it comes to running a company. 
- Culture Map
  - Must read for companies like ours. We have so many cultural issues that I‚Äôve never experienced before.
- Mergers & Acquisitions from A to Z
  - Just was curious. Super boring. 
- Bezos Letters
  - Analyzing Bezos's shareholder letters. Though I think the author reads into it a bit too much.
- HBR 10 Must Reads: On Boards
  - What are the requirements of the board? They answer that here.
- Invent and Wander
  - I liked this more than the Bezos Letters
- Antifragile
  - Yeah there isn't an opposite of fragile. Robustness is not that.
- Blitzscaling
  - I watched the YouTube series and it was funny to hear Reed Hastings says it doesn't apply to his company ü§£.
- Death by Meeting
  - Practical advice for how to run an executive team
- The Effective Executive
  - Good rules for anyone on how to manage your time more effectively.
- The Ideal Team Player
  - Practical advice for what a "team player" actually is. They try to define this ellusive term.
- The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
  - Really easy to listen to and good lessons

<h5>Investing</h5>
- Intelligent Investor
  - Must read. Mr. Market is such an interesting analogy, yelling at you from behind the fence. 
- One Up on Wall Street
  - Great simple advice. Follows nicely from Intelligent Investor.
- I read more "investment" books 5-10 years ago... 

<h5>Psychology</h5>
- Toward a Psychology of Being
  - Interesting, but I sped read through it so don‚Äôt remember so much haha. Really explains hierarchy of needs (‚Äúas grumblings‚Äù)
- Maslow on Management
  - More interesting and practical. Especially about companies helping the societies that they are in. 
- The Farther Reaches of Human Nature
  - I don‚Äôt remember much about this. I think it‚Äôs like the first one. 
- Thinking Fast & Slow
  - Great book.
- Never Split the Difference
  - Great book. Listened to it on audio book, but should also read it.
- Grit
  - Good book on toughness. Good topics on deliberate learning as well.
- Factfulness
  - Yeah our information is a bit dated. And yeah, invest in the 3rd world.


<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
- 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
  - It was cool. Bio + tech will happen.
- The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin
  - From England, to New England, to his own printing press, to boredom, to electricity, to the American Revolution. Nice read/listen.
- Wealth of Nations
  - Great read that underpins our society now.
- Das Kapital Volume 1
  - Very interesting üôÇ. I could NOT do 2 or 3‚Ä¶ it melts my brain.

  - 5 laws about success vs. capabilities and how non-linear they are.
