I began coding at 14, mainly to build websites for science projects and the various gaming clubs I was in. 

In high school, I won the Computer Engineering awards in both my junior and senior year (97% and 100% grades respectively). 

In college, I studied Information Technology, focusing on design, computer science, and business. 

After graduating, I moved to San Franciso, first working at a design agency, then a mobile gaming startup, getting acquired,  making my own startup, then working at Flickr during the Marissa Mayer era. 

In 2017, I joined the AI startup <a href="https://www.cogent.co.jp">Cogent Labs</a> in Tokyo, working mostly on AI-powered systems and the digital transformation of Japan. With no background in AI, I studied AI every night, watching & reading anything I could find. I was hired as a Research Engineer, then became a Project Manager, then became an Engineering Manager, then the Head of R&D, and now the VP of R&D. I manage many teams with backgrounds from Research to Frontend to QA to TPM.

I hold a MSc in Software Engineering from the University of Oxford and an MBA.

My motto: There's always something to learn and everyone has something to teach, as long as you stay humble, work hard, and listen attentively.

<h5>Career Highlights</h5>
<ul>
<li>In 2010, I created the visual and user experiences for the <a href="https://www.dexigner.com/news/21768">YouTube Play Exhibit</a> at the Guggeinheim in NYC. I developed the user interfaces that were showcased on a 85-inch touchscreen TV and many 25-inch touchscreens. </li>
<li>In 2012, I worked at the gaming startup Funzio, which was acquired by GREE for $210M while I was there. I was a flash engineer for Kingdom Age and the first lead backend engineer for the game <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/049829/gree-pulls-back-covers-on-online-strategy-game-war-of-nations/">War of Nations</a>. I setup the initial game architecture, sharding, and used TDD for all game logic. I also won a Hackathon.</li>
<li>In 2013, I created the social website builder Voxle.net, which powers <a href="http://oneupme.com/">OneUpMe.com</a> (~30,000 users) and <a href="http://lmtmag.com/">LMTMag.com</a> (~10,000 users). Both were developed before, but incredibly slow, and I added several things like caching layers and a new database schema.</li>
<li>In 2014, I helped create <a href="https://flickr.com/cameraroll">Flickr's Camera Roll</a> and Camera Roll Magic View. I made several significant performance improvements by removing unnecessary IO calls and cleaning up slow queries. I also fixed table de-normalization problems. I have a patent for my work on the Camera Roll.</li>
<li>In 2015, I was a part-time CTO for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/scrumpt/">Scrumpt</a>, which was #5 overall at the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield.</li>
<li>In 2017, I joined <a href="https://www.cogent.co.jp">Cogent Labs</a> and was hired onto the research team, where I helped standardize datasets, create labeling tools, and execute model trainings. I then became a project manager for our flagship Tegaki (an AI-based handwriting OCR engine). I took over the backend engineering team, stabilized the website after years of challenges, and was eventually promoted to lead all of R&D (~30 people). In 2021, I became the VP and Executive of R&D, and have made several company-wide organizational changes.</li>
<li>I read about <a href="/readinglist">20-30 books a year</a>, on topics such as psychology, process management, strategy, finance, sociology, biographies, algorithms, and deep learning.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Personal Interests</h4>

I grew up in Canada and I was a fan of hockey and American football. In high school and college, I played on several competitive teams for soccer, volleyball, and badminton. I also practiced jiu-jitsu, wushu, and gymnastics.

I also really enjoy eating. I have been to at least 15 Michelin starred restaurants, including 3 Michelin 3 stars. I live in Tokyo, which has the most Michelin starred restaurants in the world.

I love watching movies. Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott are two of my favorite directors. I particularly enjoy watching action movies in IMAX.
