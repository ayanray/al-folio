<h4>Career</h4>

I began coding at 14, to build websites for science projects and various gaming clubs. In high school, I won the Computer Engineering awards in both my junior and senior year. I studied Information Technology in college, focusing on the intersection of design, computer science, and business. After graduating, I moved to the San Franciso Bay Area, starting at a design agency, then a fast-growing startup, getting acquired, then making my own startup, then working at Flickr during the Marissa Mayer era. In 2017, I joined an AI startup in Tokyo working on DX in Japan. I was hired as a mid-level engineer and became a Yakuin (Executive) within 4 years. I hold a MSc from Oxford and an MBA.

<h5>Highlights</h5>
<ul>
<li>Created visual and user experiences for the YouTube Play Art Exhibit at the Guggeinheim. I implemented all the user interfaces that were showcased in the interactive room in the exhibit space in the Guggenheim in NYC. ✅ My work has been in the Guggenheim.</li>
<li>I was the only FE to move to the backend team at the fast growing startup Funzio, which was acquired by GREE for $210M while I was there (exited from a successful startup ✅). I was also the lead backend engineer for the hit game War of Nations. I setup the game architecture, sharding, used TDD for all game logic. When someone new joined: "You have tests 😳?!" (no other game had tests) Me: "Yes, everything's covered."  ✅ I also won the Hackathon there.</li>
<li>As an entrepreneur, I created from scratch the social website builder Voxle.net, which powers OneUpMe.com (~30,000 users) and LMTMag.com (~10,000 users) and ✅ both are still active. Additionally, I was the CTO for Scrumpt, which was a ✅ finalist (#4 overall) for TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, likely the most famous startup competition in the world.</li>
<li>At Flickr, I created the Camera Roll and Camera Roll Magic View. I made several significant performance improvements by removing unnecessary IO calls and cleaning up slow queries. I also fixed the Contacts table de-normalization problems. ✅ I have a patent for my work on the Camera Roll.</li>
<li>At Cogent, I was hired onto the research team, where I helped standardize datasets, created labeling tools that are still used today, and executed model trainings. I then became the project manager for our flagship Tegaki (handwriting OCR). I took over the backend engineering team, stabilized the website after years of challenges, and eventually promoted to lead all of R&D (27 people). In 2021, I became a VP and Executive, and have executed several organizational process changes since then.</li>
<li>I read about 20-30 books a year, on topics such as psychology, process management, strategy, finance, sociology, biographies, algorithms, and deep learning.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Personal Interests</h4>

Growing up in Canada, I was a big fan of hockey, soccer, and American Football. In high school and college, I played on several competitive teams for ⚽ soccer, 🏐 volleyball, and 🏸 badminton. I also regularly practiced jiu-jitsu, wushu, and sometimes gymnastics.

For food, I really enjoy eating. I have been to around 5-10 Michelin starred restaurants, including 2 Michelin 3 stars. There are many exceptional restaurants in Tokyo that are unranked or ask to be removed from Michelin's guide as well.

I also love watching movies. Christopher Nolan is a genius. I also love watching action movies in IMAX.

Random things I've done:
<ul>
<li>I have <a href="https://experience.porsche.com/en/track/events-and-services/training-levels-onroad/precision">Precision</a> certificate from Porsche. I was trained to drive a Porsche GT3 RS2 (0~60 in 3 seconds, $500k sticker price). I was taught high speed maneuvering, how to enter a curve, ideal lap lines, etc.</li>
<li>I have a motocycle license though I have only used it in Philippines.</li>
<li>I passed my Japanese drivers license exam on my first try (quite rare)</li>
<li>While at Oxford, I loved studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Camera">Radcliffe Camera.</a></li>
<li>I have taken baking classes in Paris for making 🥐 croissants.</li>
<li>I have been scuba diving once, while in Greece. I love 🇬🇷 Santorini, Greece though (via ATV).</li>
<li>I've been to a few Michelin 3 restaurants 😋, such as Ryugin and Joel Robuchon.</li>
<li>I have 🇨🇦 Canadian and 🇺🇸 American citizenship and 🇯🇵 Japanese permanent residency.</li>
