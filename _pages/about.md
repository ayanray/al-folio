<h4>Career</h4>

I've spent my entire career in software, where I studied Information Technology, with an interest in design, computer science, and business. After graduating, I moved to California where I spent roughly 5 years in the San Francisco Bay Area, working at a digital design agency, then a fast-growing startup, getting acquired, making my own (failed) company, and then working at Yahoo's Flickr during Marissa Mayer's reign as Yahoo CEO (truly fascinating time). I earned a Masters in Software Engineering mostly while I was at Yahoo (part-time, applied what I learned to Flickr) and an MBA while as a project manager. I currently live in Tokyo, Japan, working at an AI startup.

<h5>Highlights</h5>
<ul>
<li>Created visual and user experiences for YouTube during their 1st ever YouTube Play Exhibition at the Guggeinheim. I implemented all the user interfaces, animations, tweens, that were showcased in the HP room in the Guggenheim in NYC.</li>
<li>Only frontend engineer to move to the backend engineering team at the fast growing startup Funzio (acquired by GREE for $210M). Was Lead Backend on the hit game War of Nations for 5 months (I made all the inital systems using TDD - new dev: "you have tests?!" me: "yes, everything's covered". I also won the Hackathon there.</li>
<li>As an entrepreneur, I created almost from scratch new versions of OneUpMe.com (~30,000 users) and LMTMag.com (~10,000 users) and created the platform Voxle.net to make creating highly connected social websites like these much faster (Postgres table inheritance is fascinating).</li>
<li>At Flickr, I create the Camera Roll and Camera Roll Magic View (with a team of course). I also made several performance improvements by removing unnecessary IO calls and cleaning up slow queries. I also fixed the Contacts table sharding de-normalization fiasco.</li>
<li>At Cogent, I was hired onto the research team where I helped standardize the datasets, did some POCs and model training (on a large POC of 5M+ data points), quickly became the project manager for our flagship product Tegaki (japanese handwriting recognition), took over the backend engineering team, hired 4 people within 2 months, stabilized the website after year(s) of challenges, and then eventually took over all of R&D (~30 people) as a Vice President. My total team size I am responsible for has varied from 15 to 30 people ( mostly due to various org changes).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Personal Interests</h4>

Sports: I am a fan of football/soccer, also American football, volleyball, beach volleyball, and hockey (I grew up in Canada!). I was big into martial arts and tricking in highschool. I love kung fu movies.

Food: I definitely like to eat. I have been to maybe 10 Michelin starred restaurants, including 2 Michelin 3 stars. Many great restaurants are unranked in Tokyo, so I've been to many I thought were just incredible.

Movies: I love watching superhero movies in IMAX :).

Random things I've done:
<ul>
<li>I have <a href="https://experience.porsche.com/en/track/events-and-services/training-levels-onroad/precision">Precision</a> certificate from Porsche. I was trained to drive a Porsche GT3 RS2 (0~60 in 3 seconds) on a track. We learned high speed maneuvering, when to enter the curve, how to reduce G-force, etc. over a weekend.</li>
<li>I have a motocycle license. I have only used it in Philippines.</li>
<li>I passed my Japanese drivers license exam on my first try (apparently super rare!)</li>
<li>I have a Masters from Oxford. I love studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Camera">Radcliffe Camera.</a></li>
<li>I have taken baking classes in Paris for making croissants and similar baked goods.</li>
<li>I went scuba diving once in Greece. I don't think I like scuba diving (I'm a bit claustrophobic). I love Santorini, Greece though.</li>
<li>I've been to a few Michelin 3 restaurants, most recently Ryugin and Joel Robuchon. Tokyo has the highest density of restaurants in the world and the food culture is really amazing.</li>
<li>I have Canadian, American Citizenship and Japanese permanent residency.</li>
<li>I like to invest in stocks and I study strategy and business at home. Currently my IRR is around 50%. Future cash flow estimates backed by solid strategy & ability to execute is king.</li>
</ul>
